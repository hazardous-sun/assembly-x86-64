# The Stack 

The stack, like registers, is another way to temporarily store data.

It is called the "stack" because you can *stack* data onto it.

Imagine a stack of papers. As you stack one paper on top of another,
you can only at a given time see the contents of the paper at the top
of the stack.

A page withing the middle of the stack cannot be removed without
removing all the pages on top of it first, as the pages on top of it 
hold it in place.

## Terminology

When you **add** data onto the top of the stack, you **push** data
onto the stack.

When you **remove** data from the top of the stack, you **pop** data 
from the stack.

If you **look** at the top of the stack, without removing or adding
anything to it, this is called **peeking**.

## Stack Operations

| Operation | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `push reg\|value` | Pushes a value onto the stack |
| `pop reg` | Pops a value of the stack and stores it in `reg` |
| `mov reg, [rsp]` | Stores the peek value in `reg` |

**NOTE**: Usually in places where you can use registers, you can also
use pointers. Such as, instead of `pop [label]` to pop a value off
the stack directly into a position in memory.

## Example

Code: 
```asm
push 4 
push 8
push 3 

pop rax
call _printRAXDigit

pop rax 
call _printRAXDigit

pop rax 
call _printRAXDigit
```

Output:
```sh 
~$ ./stackexample
3 
8 
4 
```
