# Math Operations

Math operations are used to mathematically manipulate registers.

The form of a math operation is typically: `operation register, value|register`

The first register is the subject of the operation.

## Example

```asm
add rax, 5   ; the value of rax is incremented by 5
sub rbx, rax ; the value of rax is subtracted from rbx, but rax does not change
```

## Operations list 

| Operation Name | Signed Operation Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `add a, b` | - | a = a + b |
| `sub a, b` | - | a = a - b |
| `mul reg` | imul reg | rax = rax * reg |
| `div reg` | idiv reg | rax = rax / reg |
| `neg reg` | - | reg = -reg |
| `inc reg` | - | reg = reg + 1 |
| `dec reg` | - | reg = reg - 1 |
| `adc a, b` | - | a = a + b + CF |
| `sbb a, b` | - | a = a - b - CF |
