# ASCII 

ASCII is the method which modern computers represent strings of text.

Computers can only store numbers, so ASCII works by mapping numbers to specific
characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc).

ASCII uses 7-bit binary codes to represent characters. Howeber, as the byte,
which is 8-bit, is the primary unit of information, modern computers usually
support *extended ASCII*, which is 8-bit codes.

It is useful to reference an ASCII table.
