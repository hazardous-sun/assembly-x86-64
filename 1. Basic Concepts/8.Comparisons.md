# Comparisons

Comparisons allow programs to be able to take different paths based on certain conditions.

Comparisons are done on *registers*.

The general format of a comparison is:

```asm
cmp register1, register2|value
```

## Example

```asm
cmp rax, 23 
cmp rax, rbx 
```

## Comparisons with Flags

After comparison is made, certain flags are set.

| cmp a, b | |
|---|---|
| a = b | ZF = 1 |
| a != b | ZF = 0 |
| - | SF = msb(a-b) |
| ... | ... |

**NOTE**: `msb` stands for **M**ost **S**ignificant **B**it.

## Conditional Jumps

After a comparison is made, a *conditional jump* can be made.

Conditional jumps are based on the status of the flags.

Conditional jumps in code are written just like unconditional jumps, however,
`jmp` is replaced by the symbol for the conditional jump.

| Signed Jump Symbol | Unsigned Jump Symbol | Results of cmp a,b |
|---|---|---|
| je | - | a = b |
| jne | - | a != b |
| jg | ja | a > b |
| jge | jae | a >= b |
| jl | jb | a < b |
| jle | jbe | a <= b |
| jz | - | a = 0 |
| jnz | - | a != 0 |
| jo | - | Overflow occurred |
| jno | - | Overflow did not occur |
| js | - | Jump if signed |
| jns | - | Jump if not signed |

## Example

The following code will jump to the address of the label "_doThis" *if*, and 
*only if*, the value in the `rax` register equals 23:

```asm
cmp rax, 23 
je _doThis
```

The following code will jump to the address of the label "_doThis" *if*, and 
*only if*, the value in the `rax` register is greater than the value in the 
`rbx` register.

```asm 
cmp rax, rbx 
jg _doThis
```
