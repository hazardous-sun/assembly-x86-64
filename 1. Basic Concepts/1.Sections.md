# Sections 

All x86_64 assembly files have three sections, the ".data" section, the ".bss" section, and the ".text" section.

1. The ".data" is the section of all the (guess what) DATA of the application is defined befor compilation.
2. The ".bss" section is where data is allocated for future use
3. The ".text" section is where the actual code goes.

## Examples

### .data

```
section .data
        text db "Hello, World!", 10 
```

### ..bss

```
section .bss
variable: resb 4 
```

### .text

```
section .text
        global _start
```
