# Registers

Registers are a part of the processor that temporarily holds memory. 
In the x86_64 architecture, registers hold 64 bits.
This means each reigster can hold the values:

Unsigned: 
- From: `0`
- To: `18,446,744,073,709,551,616`
Signed: 
- From: `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808`
- To: `9,223,372,036,854,775,808`
