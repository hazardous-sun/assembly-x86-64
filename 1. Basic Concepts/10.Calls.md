# Calls

Calls and jumps are essentially the same.

However, when `call` is used, the original position the call was made can be returned to using `ret`.

In the following modification of the "Hello, World!" code, the part of the code that prints "Hello,
World!" was moved into its own section, and that section was *called*.

```asm
section .data
        text db "Hello, world!", 10

section .text
        global _start

_start:
        call _printHello
        
        mov rax, 60
        mov rdi, 0
        syscall

_printHello:
        mov rax, 1 
        mov rdi, 1 
        mov rsi, text
        mov rdx, 14 
        syscall
        ret
```

This is called a *subroutine*.
