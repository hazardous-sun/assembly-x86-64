# System Call

A **system call**, or **syscall**, is when a program requests a service from the **kernel**.

System calls will differ by operating system because different operating systems use different kernels.

All syscalls have an ID associated with them (a number).

Syscalls also take **arguments**, a list of inputs.

## System Call Inputs by Register

| Argument | Register |
|---|---|
| ID | rax |
| 1 | rdi |
| 2 | rsi |
| 3 | rdx |
| 4 | r10 |
| 5 | r8 |
| 6 | r9 |

**NOTE**: items starting with `#` represent a number, a value comming **directly** from a register, while
items starting with `$` represent the memmory address to the data.

| syscall | ID | ARG1 | ARG2 | ARG3 | ARG4 | ARG5 | ARG6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sys_read | 0 | #filedescriptor | $buffer | #count | | | |
| sys_write | 1 | #filedescriptor | $buffer | #count | | | |
| sys_open | 2 | $filename | #flags | #mode | | | |
| sys_close | 3 | #filedescriptor | | | | | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| pwritev2 | 326 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |


## Example

Suppose we want to write "Hello, World!\n" to the screen. To do that, we would need to call the "sys_write"
system call and use it to print text to the standard output.

- sys_write:

| Argument Type | Argument Description |
|---|---|
| File Descriptor | 0 (Standard Input), 1 (Standard Output), 2 (Standard Error) |
| Buffer | Location of the string to write. |
| Count | Length of the string. |

- Therefore:

| syscall | rax | rdi | rsi | rdx | r10 | r8 | r9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sys_write | 1 | 1 | ADDR_TO_TEXT | 14 | | | |
