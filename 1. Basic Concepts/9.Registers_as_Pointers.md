# Registers as Pointers

The default registers can be treated as pointers.

To treat a register as a pointer, surround the register name with square brackets,
such as `rax` that becomes `[rax]`.

## Example

The following code loads the value in the `rbx` register into the `rax` register:

```asm
mov rax, rbx
```

The following code loads the value the `rbx` register is *pointing* to into the 
`rax` register:

```asm
mod rax, [rbx]
```
