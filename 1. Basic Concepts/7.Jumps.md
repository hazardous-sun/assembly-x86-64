# Jumps

Jumps can be used to *jump* to different parts of code based on *labels*. 

They are used to divert program flow.

The general format of the jump is:

```asm
jmp label ; Loads the value "label" into the rip register
```

## Example

The following is an example of an infinite loop:

```asm
_start:
        jmp _start
```
