# Macros

A macro is a single instruction that expands into a predefined set of instructions to perform a 
particular task.

**NOTE**: the syntax for macros differs by assembler. 

For example, when using NASM (Netwid Assemble), the `exit` keyword expands into:

```asm
mov rax, 60
mov rdi, 0
syscall
```
